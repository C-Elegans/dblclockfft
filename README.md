# A Generic Piplined FFT Core Generator

This generic pipelined FFT project contains all of the software necessary to
create the IP to generate an arbitrary sized FFT.  The FFT has been modified
for operation in one of the following modes:

- Two samples in per clock and, after some delay, two samples out per clock.
  This uses 6 multiplies per FFT stage in the butterflies.

- One sample in per clock, with the `i_ce` line being high every clock
  (or less), every other clock (or less), or every third clock (or less).
  This mode uses 3, 2, or 1 multiplies per FFT stage respectively.

- Eventually, I want to support a real FFT mode which will accept real samples
  input, and alternately produce real and imaginary samples output--or the
  converse for the inverse FFT.

The FFT generated by this project is very configurable.  By simple adjustment
of a command line parameter, the FFT may be made to be a forward FFT or an
inverse FFT.  The number of bits processed, kept, and maintained by this
FFT are also configurable.  Even the number of bits used for the twiddle
factors, or whether or not to bit reverse the outputs, are all configurable
parts to this FFT core.

These features make this open source pipelined FFT module very different
and unique among the other open HDL cores you may fine.

For those who wish to get started right away, please download the package,
change into the ``sw`` directory and run ``make``.  There is no need to
run a configure script, ``fftgen`` is completely portable C++.  Then, once
built, go ahead and run ``fftgen`` without any arguments.  This will cause
``fftgen`` to print a usage statement to the screen.  Review the usage
statement, and run ``fftgen`` a second time with the arguments you need.

# Current State

This particular version of the FFT core is under active development.  The core
started out with only the two samples in, two samples out capability.  I'm
now working to make the core much more generic.  Sadly, there are still some
bugs in this development version of the core, but ... I'm working my way through
them.

- The double-sample FFT versions *should* work.  (They work in the master
  branch.)

- The hardware accelerated (i.e. DSP-based) butterfly has been modified for
  1-3 clocks per CE, and likewise 3-1 multiplies respectively.  This passes
  test bench muster.

- The non-accelerated butterfly can only handle 1 clock per CE.  This remains
  therefore a work in progress.

- There is no test bench for the last FFT stage in single-sample mode.

- The new and updated software doesn't yet pass test bench muster for a single
  FFT stage.

- I have yet to apply this updated (single sample input) FFT to its test bench.
  In a similar fashion, I haven't dealt with the inverse FFT yet.

My goal is to continue working with this core until it has a real-FFT capability
before releasing it back into the master branch.
